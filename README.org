#+TITLE: epkgs-sql

* Introduction

This repo contains a file of raw SQL statements to create [[https://github.com/emacsmirror/epkgs][epkgs]] database. The
official repo of [[https://github.com/emacsmirror/epkgs][epkgs]] store a binary database in the Git repository. We have to
download the whole database file while updating the epkgs database.

This repository use [[https://github.com/actions][Github Actions]] to sync from upstream and dump raw SQL
statement from binary database. SQL statements are plain text, which is
vc-friendly and make update much easier. Currently we sync upstream every 6
hours.

* Usage

To remake sqlite database from statements, first install =sqlite3= CLI tool,
then run

#+begin_src sh
test -f epkg.sqlite && rm epkg.sqlite
sqlite3 epkg.sqlite < epkg.sql
#+end_src
